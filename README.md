Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
</p>
<br />
<p>
User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Key Features
● Load data from an external source (API)
● View a list of items
● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item</p>
